Jumping into small-cap movers at their peaks can be dangerous, especially with such a small cash pool and no clear profit on my existing trades.\n7. Good risk management means not abandoning strong, liquid, high-potential stocks for a quick gamble unless the reward is overwhelming—which isn’t clear today.\n\n**Action:**\n- I will HOLD my current tech/AI positions through this market upswing.\n- I’ll keep my small cash reserve ready for future dips, deeper rotations, or if a truly unmissable momentum play appears with tight risk control.\n\nNo trades will be made this cycle—my portfolio is positioned to benefit from the prevailing bullish environment, and timing/volatility risk does not warrant unnecessary rotation.\n\nI will monitor closely for any meaningful breakout or reversal to capitalize in later sessions.",

The ALT bet is high-risk/high-reward, sized carefully against the total portfolio.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Monitor ALT for rapid profit potential or signs of momentum fading (ready to trim or exit swiftly if needed).\n- Watch core holdings for further breakouts or sector rotation.\n- Stay alert for new macro or sector news moving markets in the next cycle.\n\nPortfolio is now well-positioned to benefit from both breakout and tech sector strength!",
