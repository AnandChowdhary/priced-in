The ALT bet is high-risk/high-reward, sized carefully against the total portfolio.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Monitor ALT for rapid profit potential or signs of momentum fading (ready to trim or exit swiftly if needed).\n- Watch core holdings for further breakouts or sector rotation.\n- Stay alert for new macro or sector news moving markets in the next cycle.\n\nPortfolio is now well-positioned to benefit from both breakout and tech sector strength!",

Powell indicated potential rate cuts if inflation remains low or labor market weakness appears. Money markets suggest a likely 60 basis point cut by year-end, with a 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in September.

I will plan to sell at least half (7 shares), possibly all 14, depending on the opening price action and liquidity.\n- After capturing RIVN profits, I’ll assess redeploying part of the capital—either into another momentum leader (like VSTO, if still running) or opportunistically adding to a leading tech/AI name if a dip or breakout presents itself.\n- I will monitor opening trades and the first 30–60 minutes for execution and further opportunities.\n\n**No trades yet (pre-market), but plan is clear: realize RIVN gains at the open, then scan for the best use of fresh capital while maintaining risk discipline.**",

      "text": "As of June 26, 2025, U.S. stock index futures are rising, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs. This uptick is largely driven by strong earnings from Micron Technology, which reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue due to increased demand for AI data center chips. Micron's shares surged 2.7% in pre-market trading, and Nvidia also gained 1.2%, continuing its upward trend. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nInvestors are awaiting key economic data releases, including the Commerce Department's final Q1 GDP report, May durable goods data, and initial jobless claims, all due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, speculation is growing over former President Donald Trump potentially announcing a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later this year, raising concerns about the Fed's independence amid inflation worries stemming from tariffs and geopolitical instability. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the currency markets, the U.S. dollar is experiencing its worst first half-year performance since 1973, falling over 10% in 2025. This decline is attributed to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and political uncertainty surrounding Fed leadership, especially after Trump's recent criticisms of Powell and hints at naming a replacement. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-view-usa-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn corporate news, Nike shares edged up 0.8% ahead of its earnings report. Federal Reserve officials are also slated to speak later in the day, and Friday's PCE report will offer further insights into inflation trends. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\n\n## Key Market Updates for June 26, 2025:\n- [US stock futures rise as chips gain on Micron results; GDP data ahead](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Morning Bid: Dollar plunges as Trump pummels Powell](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-view-usa-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Morning Bid: Trump punches at Powell, dollar recoils](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/global-markets-view-europe-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai) "

This justifies maintaining—and compounding—exposure to these leaders, as momentum is intact and the news flow (earnings, product launches, analyst upgrades) remains decisively positive.\n- NIO is steady, holding its recent gains in the EV space. There’s no sign yet of a breakout or sharp pullback, so the position remains stable and leverages ongoing sector momentum.\n- PLTR pulled back to $130.74. While weakness is notable, this is not yet a sector-wide reversal—core AI/tech names are still moving higher and the rest of the portfolio can absorb some drag from a laggard.\n- No high-risk pre-market or speculative runner today offers a better risk/reward than letting NVDA, GOOGL, and NIO ride for further growth.\n- Portfolio is fully invested, with no reason to trim or rotate absent a sharp reversal or clear new leader with safer trend.\n\n**Action:**  \n- Continue holding all current positions (NVDA, GOOGL, PLTR, NIO).\n- Monitor the weekend and next week’s opening for possible risk/reversal signals, especially in second-tier AI names like PLTR. Be prepared to react quickly if momentum fades or if the market/sector leadership changes.\n- If NVDA or GOOGL show exhaustion or start underperforming, be ready to trim and rotate. But as long as leadership continues, ride the trend and let winners compound.\n\nPortfolio is well-positioned for further upside—stay agile but let the trend work!",

The S&P 500 rose 0.59% to 6,178.80, while the Nasdaq climbed to 20,299.72. Key tech stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, have seen significant gains. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-renewed-ai-bets-rate-cut-hope-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Nvidia's Growth:** Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion, reporting Q1 revenue of $44.1 billion despite an $8 billion loss in China. The company is introducing new B30 chips targeting the Chinese market amid declining market share. ([llmarketupdate.com](https://llmarketupdate.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Electric Vehicles (EVs):**\n\n- **Tesla's Sales Decline:** Tesla's EV registrations in the U.S. dropped 16% in April to 39,913, while General Motors' Chevrolet saw a 215% increase, moving into second place. Overall EV registrations fell 4.4% year-over-year in April, marking the first decline since February 2024. ([poems.com.sg](https://www.poems.com.sg/reports/daily-morning-note-16-june-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Macroeconomic Indicators:**\n\n- **Interest Rate Outlook:** The Federal Reserve is considering potential interest rate cuts, influenced by dovish signals from officials and speculation about future appointments. This has contributed to the positive market sentiment. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-renewed-ai-bets-rate-cut-hope-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Trade Developments:** The U.S. has brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, improving market sentiment despite short-term inflation concerns from increased crude prices. Additionally, trade deals with the UK and China are reversing previous market slumps linked to tariffs.

Shifting further into NVDA compounds market exposure in what's working best.\n- PLTR's sharp decline vs. tech sector strength revealed persistent rotation out of less-proven AI names. Removing underperformance risk makes the overall portfolio stronger.\n- The macro backdrop supports continued risk-on trends—record highs, positive news, and dovish central bank signals.\n\n**Action:**\n- Hold fully invested in proven leaders (AI/tech and tactical EV exposure).\n- Remain ready to trim or rebalance quickly if a sharp reversal or new, clear leader emerges.\n- Let sector winners run as long as the uptrend persists.\n\nPortfolio now maximizes trend participation with top-performing names and minimal drag.

      "text": "As of June 30, 2025, global markets are experiencing heightened volatility due to recent geopolitical events and developments in the technology sector.\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions and Market Impact**\n\nThe 12-day conflict between Israel and Iran in June 2025 has led to significant shifts in global asset dynamics. Traditional safe havens like the U.S. dollar and Treasury bonds did not attract the usual investor demand, with the DXY index at a three-year low and 10-year Treasury yields rising instead of falling. Oil prices initially surged but quickly reverted once supply fears eased. This trend suggests a potential shift from U.S. assets to international equities, as the MSCI ACWX (global equities excluding the U.S.) has risen over 13% in 2025, compared to just a 1% gain for the S&P 500. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/mideast-war-highlights-key-cross-asset-trends-watch-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Technology Sector and AI Developments**\n\nIn the technology sector, the release of China's open-source AI model, DeepSeek-R-1, has created significant market disruption. Reportedly performing comparably to models from OpenAI and Anthropic at a fraction of the training cost, this development led to a 17% loss in NVIDIA's market cap, marking the largest single-day loss for any company on Wall Street. The Philadelphia Semiconductor Index also declined by 9.2%. While some view this as a positive step for AI productivity and end users, concerns about accuracy and security remain. ([investingcongress.com](https://investingcongress.com/2025/04/10/ai-market-update-q1-2025-in-review/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Current Market Indicators**\n\nAs of the latest trading session, major indices and tech stocks have shown mixed performance:\n\n- **SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY):** $614.91, up 0.497%\n- **Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 (QQQ):** $548.09, up 0.363%\n- **Apple Inc. (AAPL):** $201.08, up 0.02%\n- **Microsoft Corporation (MSFT):** $495.94, down 0.324%\n- **NVIDIA Corp (NVDA):** $157.75, up 1.735%\n\nThese figures reflect the market's ongoing response to geopolitical tensions and technological advancements.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe global market is currently navigating a complex landscape shaped by geopolitical conflicts and rapid technological developments. Investors are advised to stay informed and consider these factors when making investment decisions.\n\n\n## Recent Developments in Global Markets and AI:\n- [MidEast war highlights key cross-asset trends to watch](https://www.reuters.com/markets/europe/mideast-war-highlights-key-cross-asset-trends-watch-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai)\n- [AI boom under threat from tariffs, global economic turmoil](https://www.reuters.com/technology/artificial-intelligence/ai-boom-under-threat-tariffs-global-economic-turmoil-2025-04-23/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Big Tech lines up over $300bn in AI spending for 2025](https://www.ft.com/content/634b7ec5-10c3-44d3-ae49-2a5b9ad566fa?utm_source=openai) "

      "text": "As of midday on June 30, 2025, U.S. stock markets are experiencing a notable rebound, with major indices reaching record highs. This surge is largely driven by renewed optimism in U.S.-Canada trade negotiations, particularly following Canada's decision to cancel its proposed digital services tax targeting U.S. tech firms. Consequently, technology stocks, including Amazon, Apple, Alphabet, and Meta, have seen gains of up to 2%. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-500-nasdaq-futures-climb-record-highs-trade-optimism-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai))\n\nGlobally, the economic recovery presents a mixed picture. While the U.S. markets are buoyant, European markets have shown slight declines, with Germany's DAX and France's CAC 40 both down 0.2%, and the UK's FTSE 100 slipping 0.3%. In contrast, Asian markets are performing well; Japan’s Nikkei 225 has risen by 0.8%, and China reports a slight improvement in factory activity following a trade truce with the U.S. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/765fd2c2e1e15aaa560da7ad3078bb53?utm_source=openai))\n\nSector leadership is evident in the technology sector, which continues to drive market gains. The Nasdaq Composite, heavily weighted towards tech stocks, has reached new all-time highs, propelled by strong performances from AI-centric companies like NVIDIA, Alphabet, and Amazon. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/stock-market-news-jun-30-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn summary, the U.S. stock market is experiencing a midday bounce on June 30, 2025, led by the technology sector, amid a complex global economic recovery landscape.\n\n\n## Global Markets React to U.S.-Canada Trade Developments:\n- [S&P 500, Nasdaq futures climb to record highs on trade optimism](https://www.reuters.com/business/sp-500-nasdaq-futures-climb-record-highs-trade-optimism-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai)\n- [World shares are mixed after US stocks hit an all-time high](https://apnews.com/article/765fd2c2e1e15aaa560da7ad3078bb53?utm_source=openai)\n- [Shares rise in Asia as US-Canada trade talks revived](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/global-markets-wrapup-1-2025-06-30/?utm_source=openai) "

      "text": "As of July 1, 2025, Nvidia's premarket stock activity reflects a complex interplay of recent developments:\n\n- **Export Restrictions to China**: In April 2025, the U.S. government imposed new restrictions requiring special licenses for exporting Nvidia's H20 AI chips to China. This led to a $4.5 billion charge in Nvidia's fiscal Q1 2026 due to diminished demand and excess inventory. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Financial Performance**: Despite the export challenges, Nvidia reported Q1 fiscal 2026 revenue of $44.1 billion, a 69% increase from the previous year. Data Center revenue reached $39.1 billion, up 73% year-over-year. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Product Innovations**: At GTC 2025, Nvidia unveiled the Blackwell Ultra AI chips and the Rubin AI chip series, with the Rubin AI chip set to launch in late 2026. These advancements underscore Nvidia's commitment to AI and data center technologies. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/457e9260aa2a34c1bbcc07c98b7a0555?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Market Sentiment**: Analysts have adjusted their outlooks in response to these developments. For instance, Goldman Sachs raised Nvidia's price target to $800, citing improved demand for AI-focused server chips and upcoming product cycles involving the B100 and H200 chips. ([fxstreet.com](https://www.fxstreet.com/amp/news/nvidia-stock-forecast-nvda-nears-700-as-the-king-of-chips-reaches-new-all-time-high-202402052105?utm_source=openai))\n\nGiven these factors, Nvidia's premarket stock performance on July 1, 2025, is likely influenced by the balance between export restrictions and strong financial results, alongside positive analyst sentiment regarding its AI initiatives.\n\n\n## Nvidia's Recent Developments and Market Impact:\n- [Nvidia modifies H20 chip for China to overcome US export controls, sources say](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-modifies-h20-chip-china-overcome-us-export-controls-sources-say-2025-05-09/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang unveils new Rubin AI chips at GTC 2025](https://apnews.com/article/457e9260aa2a34c1bbcc07c98b7a0555?utm_source=openai)\n- [Trump tariffs LIVE: PC shipments surged to prep for tariffs, NVIDIA faces AI GPU challenges in China (again)](https://www.windowscentral.com/news/live/tariffs-2025?utm_source=openai) "

The company plans to release a modified version of its H20 AI chip for China by July 2025, aiming to comply with U.S. export controls. This new version features reduced memory capacity and other limitations to meet regulatory requirements. Major Chinese tech firms, including Tencent, Alibaba, and ByteDance, have shown interest in this adjusted chip. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/nvidia-modifies-h20-chip-china-overcome-us-export-controls-sources-say-2025-05-09/?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, NVIDIA is set to participate in China's 2025 Supply Chain Expo for the first time, scheduled to begin on July 16 in Beijing. This move underscores NVIDIA's commitment to maintaining its presence in the Chinese market amid ongoing trade tensions and export restrictions. ([business-standard.com](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/nvidia-china-supply-chain-expo-us-ai-chip-export-trade-war-semicon-125061700728_1.html?utm_source=openai))\n\nOn the financial front, NVIDIA reported strong first-quarter fiscal 2026 results, with revenue reaching $44.1 billion, marking a 12% increase from the previous quarter and a 69% rise year-over-year. Despite a $4.5 billion charge related to H20 inventory adjustments due to new export licensing requirements, the company's net income grew by 26% to $18.7 billion. ([investor.nvidia.com](https://investor.nvidia.com/news/press-release-details/2025/NVIDIA-Announces-Financial-Results-for-First-Quarter-Fiscal-2026/default.aspx?utm_source=openai))\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic about NVIDIA's future performance. Barclays recently raised its price target for the company to $200, citing strong supply chain signals and robust AI demand. Similarly, Mizuho analysts have increased their 2025 forecast for NVIDIA's AI GPU shipments by 8-10%, anticipating shipments between 6.5 and 7 million units, driven by improvements in CoWoS technology and expanded production capacity. ([minipip.co.uk](https://www.minipip.co.uk/details/news/barclays-raises-nvidia-price-target-to--200-on-strong-supply-chain-signals-and-ai-demand?utm_source=openai), [marketbeatnow.com](https://marketbeatnow.com/nvidia-2025-gpu-unit-forecast-increased-by-mizuho/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese developments highlight NVIDIA's strategic efforts to navigate regulatory challenges while capitalizing on the growing demand for AI technologies.

      "text": "As of July 7, 2025, premarket data indicates a continuation of the recent sector rotation in U.S. markets, with industrial stocks showing strength and technology stocks experiencing a pullback.\n\n**Industrial Sector:**\n- The Industrial Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLI) is trading at $149.42, reflecting a modest increase of 0.81% from the previous close.\n\n**Technology Sector:**\n- The Technology Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLK) is priced at $256.96, up 1.33% from the previous close.\n\nThis trend aligns with recent market movements where investors have been rotating out of high-valuation tech stocks into sectors like industrials and healthcare. For instance, on July 1, 2025, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which has significant industrial exposure, gained 0.91%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite declined by 0.82%. ([nasdaq.com](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/trading-rotation-kicks-2nd-half-2025?utm_source=openai))\n\nAdditionally, small-cap stocks have been rallying as investors shift focus from overvalued tech giants to under-owned sectors. The Russell 2000 index, representing small-cap stocks, gained over 1% for five consecutive sessions leading up to July 1, 2025. ([fxempire.com](https://www.fxempire.com/forecasts/article/the-market-news-today-markets-await-tech-earnings-amid-ongoing-sector-rotation-1446918?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese movements suggest a strategic reallocation of capital within the market, with a growing preference for sectors perceived as offering more stable near-term earnings and dividends.

Factors such as rising interest rates and policy uncertainties have contributed to this underperformance. ([ainvest.com](https://www.ainvest.com/news/sector-rotation-strategies-volatile-market-navigating-tech-underperformance-divergent-equity-trends-2507/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Industrials Sector:** Industrials have emerged as strong performers, benefiting from increased infrastructure spending and geopolitical demand, particularly in aerospace and defense.
