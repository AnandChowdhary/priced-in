Jumping into small-cap movers at their peaks can be dangerous, especially with such a small cash pool and no clear profit on my existing trades.\n7. Good risk management means not abandoning strong, liquid, high-potential stocks for a quick gamble unless the reward is overwhelming—which isn’t clear today.\n\n**Action:**\n- I will HOLD my current tech/AI positions through this market upswing.\n- I’ll keep my small cash reserve ready for future dips, deeper rotations, or if a truly unmissable momentum play appears with tight risk control.\n\nNo trades will be made this cycle—my portfolio is positioned to benefit from the prevailing bullish environment, and timing/volatility risk does not warrant unnecessary rotation.\n\nI will monitor closely for any meaningful breakout or reversal to capitalize in later sessions.",

The ALT bet is high-risk/high-reward, sized carefully against the total portfolio.\n\n**Plan:**  \n- Monitor ALT for rapid profit potential or signs of momentum fading (ready to trim or exit swiftly if needed).\n- Watch core holdings for further breakouts or sector rotation.\n- Stay alert for new macro or sector news moving markets in the next cycle.\n\nPortfolio is now well-positioned to benefit from both breakout and tech sector strength!",

Powell indicated potential rate cuts if inflation remains low or labor market weakness appears. Money markets suggest a likely 60 basis point cut by year-end, with a 70% chance of a 25-basis point cut in September.

I will plan to sell at least half (7 shares), possibly all 14, depending on the opening price action and liquidity.\n- After capturing RIVN profits, I’ll assess redeploying part of the capital—either into another momentum leader (like VSTO, if still running) or opportunistically adding to a leading tech/AI name if a dip or breakout presents itself.\n- I will monitor opening trades and the first 30–60 minutes for execution and further opportunities.\n\n**No trades yet (pre-market), but plan is clear: realize RIVN gains at the open, then scan for the best use of fresh capital while maintaining risk discipline.**",

      "text": "As of June 26, 2025, U.S. stock index futures are rising, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq approaching record highs. This uptick is largely driven by strong earnings from Micron Technology, which reported higher-than-expected quarterly revenue due to increased demand for AI data center chips. Micron's shares surged 2.7% in pre-market trading, and Nvidia also gained 1.2%, continuing its upward trend. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nInvestors are awaiting key economic data releases, including the Commerce Department's final Q1 GDP report, May durable goods data, and initial jobless claims, all due at 8:30 a.m. ET. Additionally, speculation is growing over former President Donald Trump potentially announcing a successor to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell later this year, raising concerns about the Fed's independence amid inflation worries stemming from tariffs and geopolitical instability. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn the currency markets, the U.S. dollar is experiencing its worst first half-year performance since 1973, falling over 10% in 2025. This decline is attributed to expectations of Federal Reserve rate cuts and political uncertainty surrounding Fed leadership, especially after Trump's recent criticisms of Powell and hints at naming a replacement. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-view-usa-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn corporate news, Nike shares edged up 0.8% ahead of its earnings report. Federal Reserve officials are also slated to speak later in the day, and Friday's PCE report will offer further insights into inflation trends. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai))\n\n\n## Key Market Updates for June 26, 2025:\n- [US stock futures rise as chips gain on Micron results; GDP data ahead](https://www.reuters.com/business/us-stock-futures-rise-chips-gain-micron-results-gdp-data-ahead-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Morning Bid: Dollar plunges as Trump pummels Powell](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/global-markets-view-usa-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai)\n- [Morning Bid: Trump punches at Powell, dollar recoils](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/global-markets-view-europe-2025-06-26/?utm_source=openai) "

This justifies maintaining—and compounding—exposure to these leaders, as momentum is intact and the news flow (earnings, product launches, analyst upgrades) remains decisively positive.\n- NIO is steady, holding its recent gains in the EV space. There’s no sign yet of a breakout or sharp pullback, so the position remains stable and leverages ongoing sector momentum.\n- PLTR pulled back to $130.74. While weakness is notable, this is not yet a sector-wide reversal—core AI/tech names are still moving higher and the rest of the portfolio can absorb some drag from a laggard.\n- No high-risk pre-market or speculative runner today offers a better risk/reward than letting NVDA, GOOGL, and NIO ride for further growth.\n- Portfolio is fully invested, with no reason to trim or rotate absent a sharp reversal or clear new leader with safer trend.\n\n**Action:**  \n- Continue holding all current positions (NVDA, GOOGL, PLTR, NIO).\n- Monitor the weekend and next week’s opening for possible risk/reversal signals, especially in second-tier AI names like PLTR. Be prepared to react quickly if momentum fades or if the market/sector leadership changes.\n- If NVDA or GOOGL show exhaustion or start underperforming, be ready to trim and rotate. But as long as leadership continues, ride the trend and let winners compound.\n\nPortfolio is well-positioned for further upside—stay agile but let the trend work!",

The S&P 500 rose 0.59% to 6,178.80, while the Nasdaq climbed to 20,299.72. Key tech stocks, including Nvidia and AMD, have seen significant gains. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-renewed-ai-bets-rate-cut-hope-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Nvidia's Growth:** Nvidia has become the world's most valuable company with a market capitalization of $3.5 trillion, reporting Q1 revenue of $44.1 billion despite an $8 billion loss in China. The company is introducing new B30 chips targeting the Chinese market amid declining market share. ([llmarketupdate.com](https://llmarketupdate.com/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Electric Vehicles (EVs):**\n\n- **Tesla's Sales Decline:** Tesla's EV registrations in the U.S. dropped 16% in April to 39,913, while General Motors' Chevrolet saw a 215% increase, moving into second place. Overall EV registrations fell 4.4% year-over-year in April, marking the first decline since February 2024. ([poems.com.sg](https://www.poems.com.sg/reports/daily-morning-note-16-june-2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Macroeconomic Indicators:**\n\n- **Interest Rate Outlook:** The Federal Reserve is considering potential interest rate cuts, influenced by dovish signals from officials and speculation about future appointments. This has contributed to the positive market sentiment. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-renewed-ai-bets-rate-cut-hope-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Trade Developments:** The U.S. has brokered a ceasefire between Israel and Iran, improving market sentiment despite short-term inflation concerns from increased crude prices. Additionally, trade deals with the UK and China are reversing previous market slumps linked to tariffs. ([reuters.com](https://www.reuters.com/business/finance/sp-500-nasdaq-hit-record-highs-renewed-ai-bets-rate-cut-hope-2025-06-27/?utm_source=openai))\n\n**Market Mood:**\n\nOverall, the market mood is optimistic, with significant rebounds in major indices driven by tech stocks and AI advancements. However, investors remain cautious due to ongoing macroeconomic risks, including trade disputes and global conflicts.

Shifting further into NVDA compounds market exposure in what's working best.\n- PLTR's sharp decline vs. tech sector strength revealed persistent rotation out of less-proven AI names. Removing underperformance risk makes the overall portfolio stronger.\n- The macro backdrop supports continued risk-on trends—record highs, positive news, and dovish central bank signals.\n\n**Action:**\n- Hold fully invested in proven leaders (AI/tech and tactical EV exposure).\n- Remain ready to trim or rebalance quickly if a sharp reversal or new, clear leader emerges.\n- Let sector winners run as long as the uptrend persists.\n\nPortfolio now maximizes trend participation with top-performing names and minimal drag.
