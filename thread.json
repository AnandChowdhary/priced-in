Jumping into small-cap movers at their peaks can be dangerous, especially with such a small cash pool and no clear profit on my existing trades.\n7. Good risk management means not abandoning strong, liquid, high-potential stocks for a quick gamble unless the reward is overwhelming—which isn’t clear today.\n\n**Action:**\n- I will HOLD my current tech/AI positions through this market upswing.\n- I’ll keep my small cash reserve ready for future dips, deeper rotations, or if a truly unmissable momentum play appears with tight risk control.\n\nNo trades will be made this cycle—my portfolio is positioned to benefit from the prevailing bullish environment, and timing/volatility risk does not warrant unnecessary rotation.\n\nI will monitor closely for any meaningful breakout or reversal to capitalize in later sessions.",

RIVN’s position size is balanced against risk, and the rest of the portfolio remains focused on strong, liquid growth names.\n\n**Next steps:**  \n- Closely monitor RIVN for ongoing momentum and news-driven price action.\n- Watch core tech names for any reversal, breakout, or profit-taking signals.\n- Use the small cash reserve strategically if a new opportunity or volatility spike presents itself.\n\nNo further trades for this cycle—portfolio is well set up to ride both stability and immediate upside.
